The aim of the project is to create prognos which describes the amount of air passengers in specified month(July) based
on the cost of the fuel in U.S.A.

In that folder, we have 3 py files and 3 csv files which is needed to show behaviour of the project. However, there is ipynb file , if you want to see graphs in better way.

We can use that py files to take data from datasets in 2 websites : https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp?pn=1 and https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=1

After that run project.py to see graph with given points , linear regression and predict.

Also added 1 screenshot from ipynb file. It includes the graph(based on default points),graph without lambda and graph with best coefficient of Lambda(shows the lowest error) and final predict.

Hint : blue points are train. red points are validation.
